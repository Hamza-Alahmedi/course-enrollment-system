## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Local Development
**Your local setup still works!**
- Run `start-all.bat` as usual
- Backend on localhost:8080
- Frontend on localhost:5173
- Nothing changed locally

### Cloud vs Local
**You can use both!**
- Develop locally (faster, easier debugging)
- Deploy to cloud (share with others)
- They're independent

### Environment Variables
**How it works**:
```
Local: Uses default values (localhost, etc.)
Cloud: Uses Render environment variables
```
Your code automatically detects where it's running!
